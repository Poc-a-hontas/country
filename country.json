        After 2 years of full time traveling, I felt like I’d had enough of adventure. I wanted to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone, on a different level this time. I might be the only person on this Earth but I actually wanted to experience being broke and all on my own and having to figure that all out. Because I believe that’s how we grow.

And so I packed my stuff and headed north.
I mean, I am not gonna lie to you. It is not easy. During the first week, I slept on a floor, no bed, no mattress, just a pillow and a hope for better days.
The study program is demanding and working on the side to get SU is super time consuming. And it is windy and rainy a way too many days in a year. Plus everything is expensive and the only thing harder than Danish is making Danish friends. But trust me, it is all soo worth it.

After a long time I feel like I am moving forward again. I feel happy. I feel purpose. And well if I can do it, so can you. 
Love, 
Katerina♡

        I didn’t know what I wanted to do but I was pretty sure of wanting to stay in Denmark. 
I was building my life around this desire. 
I moved to my favorite city in Denmark - Aarhus. 
When I was looking for a stable job I had to find my way of surviving. I didn’t have a CPR number. I couldn’t open a bank account. My funds were getting smaller and all my job applications didn’t get a response. 
I became a ‘freelance’ dog sitter. It was not a lot but I was able to pay my rent. 
There was someone interested in my dog sitting service so they added me to friends on Facebook but then they never hired me. 
Days passed by and I found a normal job and my life was becoming more stable. 
I was surprised to see an invitation to a Halloween party from a guy who didn’t hire me as a dog sitter after all. I didn’t know anyone who was invited except for another couple I used to do dog sitting for. 
I didn’t have any plans for Halloween but it felt very weird - going to somebody's house party where you don’t know anyone. My inner saboteur was strongly advising against it. But I knew I wanted to go. I didn’t want to sit alone in my apartment. I asked myself - what’s the worst thing that could happen? If it’s uncomfortable I can always leave. If people think I’m weird for coming I probably won’t ever see them again anyway. 
I had more reasons to go than to not go. 
And so I went. 
It was a bit awkward at the beginning, but the more into the night the more fun I had. 
I met some people I’m still in touch with. 
I danced my worries away and had a great time. 
It pays off to put yourself out there, to take that step. 
I did and it was worth it.
